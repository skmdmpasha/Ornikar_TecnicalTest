    Selenium Python Behave BDD & Selenium WebDriver

## Description
An in-depth view on automation project Structure and overview.

It uses python's requests for performing HTTP requests, nose for most assertions, trafaret for json validation and behave for BDD style of tests.
used nose for most assertions, trafaret for json validation and behave for BDD style of tests

To demonstrate the usage of Python Behave with local Selenium WebDriver, Iâ€™ll take the example of a       simple ornikar websitep.

You can see the snapshot of the project directory below, to be used in this Selenium Python framework.

## Project Structure
Feature files are intended to locate in /features folder

Corresponding steps are located in /features/steps

Overall project structure is as follows:

[Root Directory] - Python_Bdd

        |---------------------- [behave.ini | setup.cfg] (Optional Config Settings)

Configuration files (behave.ini, setup.cfg, tox.ini, and .behaverc) in Python Behave do not have problems like fixtures and can be used to setup the environment.

## Getting Started
    Clone project

    Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install required dependencies

### Installing & setup env
    #-----environment creation--------

    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt

### CI reports
* ALLURE Reports
* Reports are generated into /reports folder
* Behave support JUnit reports, that are easily parsed by CI tools

### Running program
# to execute all feature files (all tests)
behave features

# to execture specific feature
behave features/*.feature

# to see printed output add --no-capture
behave --no-capture

# run features with specific tags
behave --tags=without_login --tags=slow

```
